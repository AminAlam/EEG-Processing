### STFT and Spectogram

#### STFT
STFT and Spectogram both are methods for time-frequency analysis of the signals. STFT focuses on the FT of windowed and segmented (overlaped) data and the output can be used to reconstruct the original (under certain condition). 
#### Spectogram
Spectrogram focuses on the spectral estimation based on STFT.  It has the options for power spectrum or power spectrum density.  It has the option of 'reassigned' to sharpen spectrogram.
