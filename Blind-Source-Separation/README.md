### PCA and ICA

Independent components analysis and principal component analysis both are blind source separation techniques for obtaining sources of the signal using the signal's statistical features.
#### PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique of multivariable and megavariate analysis which may provide arguments for reducing a complex data set to a lower dimension and reveal some hidden and simplified structure/patterns that often underlie it. The main goal of Principal Component Analysis is to obtain the most important characteristics from data. [Source](https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/18539/fr1d4.pdf)
#### ICA
ICA is a statistical technique very useful in systems involving multivariable data. The general idea is to change the space from an m-dimensional to an n-dimensional space such that the new space with the transformed variables (components) describes the essential structure of the data containing the more relevant information from the sensors. Among its virtues is that ICA has a good performance in pattern recognition, noise reduction and data reduction. The goal of ICA is to find new components (new space) that are mutually independent in complete statistical sense. [Source](https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/18539/fr1d4.pdf)
